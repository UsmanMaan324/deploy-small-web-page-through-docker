Firstly we created the docker file and create the enginx container.

After creating the enginx container, we replace our html file with the enginx html file.

At last we push our docker image on our docker hub repository.

# Pull

In pull function we only pull our docker image that we upload on docker hub and run.


Both push and pull are done automatically by writing shell script
